# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple game using rock paper scissors, it's you versus the computer, its best of 3 rounds, but the maximum rounds in total you can have is 9 rounds, when it goes over 9 rounds it stops the game and outputs it's a draw and asks if you want to have another match (y or n). This option is also included when you or the computer has won 3 rounds in total and therefore a victory.
There's no pictures involved, as It'd evolved into a intermeditate or advanced project instead of a beginner project.

This was inspired by the youtube video called 12 Beginner Python Projects by freeCodeCamp.org on youtube, but not copied.

The numbers for repition of rounds/winning total is always changeable, but the numbers I here would set best on making a fair and fun game, and therefore classified as default (in my opinion anyways)
